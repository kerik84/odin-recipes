    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>1 000 gram minced meat</li>
        <li>4 pcs carrots</li>
        <li>1 pcs yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 pcs celery sticks</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 can tomato puree</li>
        <li>2 bokser chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 dl bull broth</li>
        <li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili flake</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>olive oil for frying</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Cheese sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp wheat flour</li>
        <li>8 dl milk</li>
        <li>50 gram ridder cheese / white cheese</li>
        <li>50 gram parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tsp grounded nutmeg</li>
        <li>Homemade Pasta Plates</li>
        <li>300 gram wheat flour (tipo 00)</li>
        <li>190 gram egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Topping</li>
        <li>100 gram grated cheese</li>
        <li>50 gram fresh mozzarella</li>
        <li>a little olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a pan and pour in a little olive oil. Put on medium + heat. Cut up onions, carrots, celery sticks and garlic and place in the pan. Cook until soft. Add tomato puree and sugar. Fry a little before adding chopped tomatoes and beef broth.</li>
        <li>Fry the minced meat little by little in a hot pan. When you do this, the minced meat is fried and not cooked. Great if you get a little crust on the minced meat. When you have finished the minced meat, pour over together with the tomato sauce and let the sauce simmer for a minimum of 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Cheese sauce: melt butter and stir in the flour. Add milk little by little and stir well so that there are no lumps. Boil 4-5 min and add ridder cheese / grated cheese, parmesan and Dijon mustard. Season with salt, pepper and ground nutmeg.</li>
        <li>You can either buy ready-made lasagne plates, but if you want to try making it yourself, you will get an even better result. Mix together flour, eggs and salt and knead well. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes. Roll out as thinly as you can or use a pasta machine. I bought an accessory for my Bosch kitchen machine and it works great. Boil for 2 minutes in salted water and place them on a kitchen towel to dry a bit.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to put the lasagna together. Start with a little cheese sauce at the bottom and place pasta plates over this. Add a thin layer of meat sauce, a new layer of cheese sauce and then pasta plates. I usually make 5 layers of pasta plates and always finish with meat sauce and cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Finish by sprinkling a little more grated cheese and fresh mozzarella. Finish with a few good drops of olive oil and a little salt and pepper. This gives a wonderfully good crust on top.</li>
        <li>Put the pan in a preheated oven at 200 degrees hot air. Let it cook for 25 minutes. It is very important that a Lasagna is allowed to rest a little before you cut it up and serve it. Minimum 10 minutes so it has time to get a little firmer. Serve with a fresh salad, a little extra parmesan and garlic baguettes. Good luck!</li>
